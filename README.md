## Executive Summary

Italy’s National Health Service is moving to integrate telemedicine as a structural response to chronic disease management, population ageing, and healthcare workforce shortages. Supported by PNRR funding and a growing regulatory framework that clarifies responsibilities and care pathways, telemedicine—enabled by ICT and IoT devices—can improve the effectiveness and targeting of home-based support for older adults.

Evidence suggests that demographic factors (e.g., proximity to children and social isolation) correlate with adoption, but cross-country comparisons indicate that the main driver is sustained public investment. Adoption is also constrained by affordability: many seniors cannot fully bear device and service costs, which remain high due to R&D intensity and limited economies of scale. For this reason, public incentives and reimbursement schemes—already used in several European countries—are critical to scale deployment and sustain technological progress.

Irbema is well positioned to benefit from this shift by prioritizing the public sector, integrating its device into multiple telemedicine platforms to gain visibility in a fragmented market, and partnering with sector players. The proposed offering combines teleassistance (social and psychological support) with telemonitoring of health conditions, with future value enhanced by predictive AI/ML functionalities. While health and quality-of-life benefits are well documented, the economic impact requires longer-horizon evaluation: an initial payback analysis for heart failure suggests multi-year recovery, with unit costs expected to decline over time. A next step is a full cost-effectiveness assessment (QALYs/ICER) to support pricing and reimbursement decisions that are sustainable for both the SSN and Irbema.
